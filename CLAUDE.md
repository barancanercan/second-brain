# CLAUDE.md: Project Context

This file provides context for the Claude AI assistant to understand the structure and purpose of this directory.

## Directory Overview

This directory is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) Vault, serving as a "second brain" and knowledge management system for an AI/LLM Engineer. The vault is structured to manage research papers, model experiments, datasets, prompt engineering recipes, and daily engineering logs.

The primary content is organized within the `AI_LLM_Engineering/` directory, which follows a system similar to PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive) for long-term knowledge management.

## Key Files & Structure

-   **`AI_LLM_Engineering/`**: The root folder for all engineering-related notes.
    -   **`00_Baslangic.md`**: An introductory guide (in Turkish) that explains the folder structure and its intended use.
    -   **`00_Inbox/`**: For quick, unsorted notes and ideas.
    -   **`01_Projects/`**: Contains subdirectories for specific, active projects with defined goals.
    -   **`02_Areas/`**: Holds notes on broad, ongoing areas of interest and responsibility. This includes:
        -   `Papers/`: For storing and summarizing research papers.
        -   `Datasets/`: Notes related to datasets.
        -   `Experiments/`: Logs and results from model experiments.
        -   `Prompts/`: A library of reusable prompt recipes.
    -   **`03_Resources/`**: A library for templates, code snippets, and other reusable assets.
    -   **`04_Archive/`**: For completed or inactive projects and notes.
    -   **`99_Logs/`**: Contains daily engineering logs organized by year and date (e.g., `2026/2026-01-16_Daily_Log.md`).

-   **`.obsidian/`**: The configuration directory for the Obsidian vault.
    -   **`community-plugins.json`**: This file indicates that the vault uses the following community plugins:
        -   `calendar`: For visualizing and navigating to daily notes.
        -   `templater-obsidian`: For creating notes from templates (e.g., new daily logs or experiment reports).
        -   `terminal`: To open a terminal panel directly within Obsidian.

## Usage

This directory is intended to be opened and managed as a vault using the Obsidian application. The workflow is designed around:

1.  **Capturing Knowledge**: Adding notes, papers, and ideas into the appropriate folders.
2.  **Project Tracking**: Managing active work within the `01_Projects` directory.
3.  **Daily Journaling**: Using the `99_Logs` section to record daily progress and insights, potentially using the `Calendar` plugin for easy navigation.
4.  **Templating**: Using the `Templater` plugin to create new notes with a consistent structure.
